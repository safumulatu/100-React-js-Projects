Ultimate 100+ React JS Projects That Will Make You Forget Your Sleep (But Hey, It’s Worth It)
#Counter App (Because We Love Clicking Buttons):
A simple app where you can count to infinity... or until your finger cramps. Also, useful to show off how much of a pro you are at managing state! You click, the number goes up. Exciting, right? 😂

#Simple To-Do App (AKA, the List You’ll Never Finish):
Make a to-do list so long, you’ll need a second app to manage your list of to-dos. But hey, you can check stuff off! The real challenge? Remembering what you need to do in the first place.

#Meals API Fetching (Feed Me Data, Feed Me!):
Fetch meals from an API, and pretend like you're the next Gordon Ramsay. Too bad you can’t actually eat the data, but hey, your app looks delicious! 🍔

#Calculator App (Mathing Like a Boss):
A fancy calculator for when Google just isn’t good enough. Plus, who doesn’t want to feel like a hacker while crunching numbers in their own app? Quick tip: Don’t trust this for your taxes… or do. YOLO. 😎
